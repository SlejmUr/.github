# Introduction 
Hi, I am currently a student who is currently studying Computer Science.\
I used many names in platforms but now it staying "SlejmUr" for now.\
I have many projects that is heavily in grey areas (Server emulators, reverse engineering, etc)\
Because when I playing and having fun I started to research how those game works and learn from it.

# Projects
I have many projects over years basically what interested for me in those times.\
Latest interests: Extract Into Void, Godot, SCP: Secret Laboratory.

### Extract Into Void
This is a game that I been working on, kinda like "one of my dream game". \
Free, Open source, 3D "Extraction" Shooter and moddable!\
It's an unpaid project, mainly for more learning.\

### SCP:SL
In my freetime started watching videos and after some time, I started playing.\
Then I saw it can be modded and stared doing more and more plugins/mod for it.\
First made some mini events then the big "SimpleCustomRole" mod/plugin featured in Kadava's server.\
Then I joined SCP:SL MK (Magyar Közösség) as a Plugin developer, helping them for their future projects while keeping my others up-to-date.\

### Godot and EOS/Steam
After failed attempt to make EFT a game for my suitable case. I started learning Godot.\
I helped GodotSteam and the C# Binding I currently looking how I could make "Another C# Binding for Steam/EOS".
EOS is bringing me to learn and seek out since it would be a great platform if the loading wouldn't be so long.\

### Escape From Tarkov
We wanted to seek out a game after siege and it landed on EFT.\
A game that is highly cheatable. And have a big community on SPT side.\
The "dream" was to make a complete server in Unity engine, it didn't worked so I just abandoned.\
Thanks for learning experience SIT, AKI/SPT, MTGA!\

### Linux, Discord bot
Linux was there because I wanted to help RavePriest1 with the .sh scripts and such.\
Discord bot exists because I wanted to show a special text channel to type when in voice, and also clone every message to other server.\
[Ubuntu Scripts](https://github.com/SlejmUr/UbuntuScripts)
[Py Bots](https://github.com/SlejmUr/SlejmPyBots)

### UplayDB and Ubisoft
After researching and getting into it thanks to Claabs for making a Ubisoft DMX research\
I started my own way of applications and SDKs.\
The "dream" would be making a same thing as SteamDB but for uplay.\
After many consideration and Ubisoft putting every DRM into their games, applications I just only do the bare minimum to the sdks be usable.\

### Rainbow Six: Siege
This was originally when we wanted to play older version of game.\
Was fun, until like Y6, since I completely abandoned since dont think someone want to play newer version.\
Created some tools for modding (well memory editing) and downloading older version of it. (Thanks to DepotDownloader)\

Thanks to NetCoreServer I started doing my own thing top on it so the "ModdableWebServer" created.\
And using this the PayCheck3 (PayDay 3) Server Emulator created for making playable offline.\
