# Introduction 
Hi, I am currently a student who is currently studying Computer Science.\
I used many names in platforms but now it staying "SlejmUr" for now.\
I have many projects that is not great and heavily in grey areas (Server emulators, etc)\
Because when I playing and having fun I started to research how those game works and learn from it.\

# Projects
I have many projects over years basically what interested for me in those times.\
Latest interests: Extract Into Void, Godot, SCP: Secret Laboratory.

You can find a groups of my project (or probably just dump the links here)/
Sorting from older to newest.

### Rainbow Six: Siege
This was originally when we wanted to play older version of game.\
Was fun, until like Y6, since I completely abandoned since dont think someone want to play newer version.\
Created some tools for modding (well memory editing) and downloading older version of it. (Thanks to DepotDownloader)

### UplayDB and Ubisoft
After researching and getting into it thanks to Claabs for making a Ubisoft DMX research\
I started my own way of applications and SDKs.\
The "dream" would be making a same thing as SteamDB but for uplay.\
After many consideration and Ubisoft putting every DRM into their games, applications I just only do the bare minimum to the sdks be usable.

### Linux, Discord bot
Linux was there because I wanted to help RavePriest1 with the .sh scripts and such.\
Discord bot exists because I wanted to show a special text channel to type when in voice, and also clone every message to other server.\

### Escape From Tarkov
We wanted to seek out a game after siege and it landed on EFT.\
A game that is highly cheatable. And have a big community on SPT side.\
The "dream" was to make a complete server in Unity engine, it didn't worked so I just abandoned.\
Thanks for learning experience SIT, AKI/SPT, MTGA!

### Godot and EOS/Steam
After failed attempt to make EFT a game for my suitable case. I started learning Godot.\
I helped GodotSteam and the C# "Extension" I currently looking how I could make "Another C# Binding for Steam/EOS".
EOS is bringing me to learn and seek out since it would be a great platform if the loading wouldn't be so long.

### SCP:SL
In my freetime started watching videos and after some time, I started playing.\
Then I saw it can be modded! And then stared doing more and more fun stuff for it.\
First some mini events then the big "SimpleCustomRole" mod/plugin featured in Kadava's server.\
Then I joined SCP:SL MK (Magyar Közösség) as a Plugin developer, helping them for their future projects while keeping other up-to-date.

### Extract Into Void
This is a game that I been working on, kinda like "one of my dream game". \
Free, Open source, 3D "Extraction" Shooter and moddable!\
It's an unpaid project, mainly for more learning.

## Others
Thanks to NetCoreServer I started doing my own thing top on it so the "ModdableWebServer" created.\
And using this the PayCheck3 (PayDay 3) Server Emulator created for making playable offline.\
